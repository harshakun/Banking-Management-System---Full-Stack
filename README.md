## ‚ú® Features

This project includes a wide range of features for a complete banking workflow:

#### **üë§ Customer Portal**
* **Secure Registration & Login:** New users can register with their details, and log in securely using their Account Number or Aadhar Number.
* **Account Dashboard:** After logging in, users see a summary of their account details, including name, account number, and current balance.
* **Transactions:** Perform secure Credit (deposit) and Debit (withdrawal) transactions. The database prevents overdrafts.
* **Payment Statement:** View a detailed history of all transactions for a specified period.
* **Account Deletion:** Users can securely delete their own account after a confirmation prompt.

#### **üè¶ Admin Portal**
* **KYC Management:** View a list of all pending new account applications.
* **Approve/Decline:** Approve new accounts (which generates the account number) or decline them with a required reason.
* **Account Overview:** View a table of all active, approved accounts in the bank.
* **Admin Transactions:** Post transactions (deposits/withdrawals) on behalf of any customer.
* **Admin Deletion:** Securely delete any customer account from the system.

#### **üîê Security**
* **JWT Authentication:** Uses JSON Web Tokens for secure, stateless user sessions after login.
* **Protected Routes:** API endpoints are protected with middleware, ensuring a logged-in user can only access their own data.
* **Data Integrity:** Database-level rules (triggers and constraints) enforce business logic like preventing negative balances and ensuring unique Aadhar numbers.
